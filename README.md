## Description

Simple Crud is a gem for Rails that simplifies writing standard CRUD actions, while also adding tools so it's not needed to write tests for them. Its main objective is replacing generally copy-pasted code like generic paginated, authenticated index methods for simple lines such as
```ruby
simple_crud_for :index
```
It includes support for index, create, destroy, update and show, and options to specify whether it should apply pagination, authorization and if a particular serializer should be used. Keep in mind, though, that the idea is not to replace writing methods in controllers altogether, but only to replace most standard cases.

## Installation
Add the following line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simple_crud'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install simple_crud
```

## Usage
### Setup
#### Application controller
Before SimpleCrud can be used, some boilerplate is needed. Add the following to your ApplicationController (or every controller in case you don't want it included in all controllers)
```ruby
include Pundit
extend SimpleCrud

before_action :set_params

def set_params
  SimpleCrudController.params = params
end
```


### Each controller
In case you need either update or create, create a method with the valid input params using standard rails:
```ruby
def author_params
  params.permit(:first_name, :email, :last_name, :institution, :role)
end
```

For the actual crud methods, just use the lines you need
```ruby
simple_crud_for :update
simple_crud_for :show
simple_crud_for :index
simple_crud_for :create
simple_crud_for :destroy
```

Each method supports different options, as in:
```
simple_crud_for :index, paginate: false, authorize: false, serializer: CustomSerializer
```

- Paginate: whether it should paginate or not. `true` paginates using wor-paginate, `false` doesn't paginate
- Authorize: whether it should use Pundit to automatically check if the action is permitted
- Authenticate: whether it should use Devise to check for a current_user
- Serializer: specify a particular serializer you should use

You'll need a few things so they work correctly:

### Options
#### Paginate
No options are needed, but the pagination is done using [wor-paginate](https://github.com/Wolox/wor-paginate) so read the documentation in case you need to customize the output.

#### Authorize
The name of the policy should be the model followed by Policy, as in `AuthorPolicy`. Support for custom policies is upcoming. The policy should be a standard Pundit policy, for example:

```ruby
class AuthorPolicy
  attr_reader :user, :author

  def initialize(user, author)
    @user = user
    @author = author
  end

  def show?
    user.present?
  end
end

```

#### Authenticate
SimpleCrud will assume a current_user method. Future versions will support a custom model. Defining a current_user method in ApplicationController should work if you're using a different model, as of now.

#### Serializer
The name of the serializer, by default, is the name of the model followed by Serializer, as is the standard for [ActiveModelSerializers](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers). It's possible to just pass a custom serializer class though. As for the serializer itself, it's a standard serializer, with the gotcha that you need to include `:id` for the SimpleCrud examples to work.

```ruby
class AuthorSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :email, :first_name, :last_name, :institution, :role, :id
end
```

### Shared examples
While optional, using the included shared examples saves you from writing the standard test cases for the methods. You can even use them if you didn't use `simple_crud_for`, as a set of basic tests. To include them, just add `require 'simple_crud/rspec'` to your `rails_helper.rb` file and add the lines you need to your `*_spec.rb` files:
```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

describe V1::Backoffice::AuthorsController do
  include_examples 'simple crud for update'
  include_examples 'simple crud for show'
  include_examples 'simple crud for create'
  include_examples 'simple crud for index'
  include_examples 'simple crud for destroy'
end
```

It's not needed to specify paginate: true and such, since the shared examples will use the configuration that was originally passed to simple_crud_for
